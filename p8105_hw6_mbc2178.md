### Problem 1

### Problem 2

Let’s examine the Washington Post’s data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities. We will refer to this raw dataset as `homicide_df`.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv('data/homicide-data.csv', col_names = TRUE) 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The `homicide_df` contains data from 50 large cities in the U.S. with 12
fields or variables and 52179 records or observations. This dataset
includes first and last names as well as ethnicity of homicide victims
(`victim_last`,`victim_first`, `victim_race`), dates of homicide report
(`reported_date`) and the status of cases characterized as closed with
arrest or closed without arrest (`disposition`). In addition, the
dataset also contains the longitude (`lon`) and latitude (`lat`) of the
cities where the homicide occurred.

Let’s perform some data cleaning and manipulation on `homicide_df` using
the `janitor::clean_names()` and `mutate`. We ensured that `victim_age`
is a numeric variable by using an `if_else` statement that would apply
NA to all missing values.

New variables `city_state` and a binary variable `homicide_solved` with
0 and 1 to indicate whether the homicide is solved were created. In
addition, we limit our analysis for those whose `victim_race` is white
or black and exclude the following cities Dallas,TX,Phoenix, AZ, and
Kansas City, MO because these don’t report victim race. Also, we omit
Tulsa,AL because it is a data entry mistake.

``` r
homicide_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city,',',state),
    homicide_solved = if_else(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0),
    victim_age = ifelse(victim_age > 0, as.numeric(victim_age), NA)) %>% 
    
    filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO","Tulsa,AL"),
           victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) 
```

Let’s now fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the
outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors for the city of
Baltimore, MD.

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% 
  select(victim_sex, victim_age, victim_race, homicide_solved, city_state) %>% 
  arrange(desc(homicide_solved))
```

Let’s run the logistic regression in this step

``` r
logfit_baltimore = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 
```

Let’s perform manipulations to obtain adjusted odds ratio estimates with
95% CI for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
logfit_baltimore %>% 
   broom::tidy() %>% 
  ## Exponentiate betas to obtain odds ratio & 95% CI
  mutate(
    log_OR = round(exp(estimate),3),
    CL_UpperLimit = round(exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error),3),
    CL_LowerLimit = round(exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),3),
    term = str_replace(term, "^victim_sexMale", "Victim Sex: Male")) %>% 
  
     select(term, log_OR,CL_LowerLimit, CL_UpperLimit) %>% 
  
    filter(term == "Victim Sex: Male") %>% 
  rename('95%CI Upper Limit'= CL_UpperLimit ,
         '95%CI Lower Limit' = CL_LowerLimit,
         'Estimate' = log_OR,
          'Covariate' = term) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Table 1. Adjusted Odds Ratio for solving homicides", align = "lccrr")
```

| Covariate        | Estimate | 95%CI Lower Limit | 95%CI Upper Limit |
|:-----------------|:--------:|:-----------------:|------------------:|
| Victim Sex: Male |  0.443   |       0.337       |             0.583 |

Table 1. Adjusted Odds Ratio for solving homicides

``` r
#### USE CONFINT to check if 95% CI calculations is correct 
```

Let’s run a regression function for each of the cities in our
`homicide_df` dataset and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for
solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. We use
`purrr:map` and `nest` to create a dataframe and apply the `glm`
function to obtain estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
cities_reg = 
  homicide_df %>% 
    nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, 
                            family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
     select(-data,-models) %>% 
       unnest(results) 
```

``` r
cities_fit = 
  cities_reg %>% 
## Exponentiate betas to obtain odds ratio & 95% CI
  mutate(
    log_OR = round(exp(estimate),3),
    CL_UpperLimit = round(exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error),3),
    CL_LowerLimit = round(exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),3),
    term = str_replace(term, "^victim_sexMale", "Victim Sex: Male")) %>% 
  
     select(city_state, term, log_OR,CL_LowerLimit, CL_UpperLimit) %>% 
  
    filter(term == "Victim Sex: Male") %>% 
    arrange(city_state) 
  
  ## rename( 'Cities' = city_state, 
        ##  '95%CI UpperLimit'= CL_UpperLimit ,
          ##'95%CI LowerLimit' = CL_LowerLimit,
          ## 'Estimate' = log_OR,
        ##  'Covariate' = term) 
  
 ##   knitr::kable(caption = "Table 2. Adjusted Odds Ratio for solving homicides in 50 cities", align = "lccrr")

cities_fit %>% 
rename( 'Cities' = city_state, 
        '95%CI UpperLimit'= CL_UpperLimit ,
        '95%CI LowerLimit' = CL_LowerLimit,
         'Estimate' = log_OR,
         'Covariate' = term) %>% 
  
   knitr::kable(caption = "Table 2. Adjusted Odds Ratio for solving homicides in 50 cities", align = "ccccc")

Table 2. Adjusted Odds Ratio for solving homicides in 50 cities

Below we create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each
city. The graph is organized by cities according to the estimated OR.

``` r
model_plot = 
  cities_fit %>% 
  arrange(log_OR) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=city_state, y= log_OR)) + 
  geom_point() +
  
  ## Confidence Intervals 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin =CL_LowerLimit, ymax= CL_UpperLimit), width =.2, 
                position = position_dodge(0.05)) +
  
  ## Style format
  labs(title = "Adjusted Odds Ratio of unsolved homicides comparing males to females across U.S. Cities") +
  xlab("Cities") +
  ylab("Adjusted Odds Ratios") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) 

model_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_mbc2178_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
#Interactive plot
#ggplotly(cities_plot)
```

### Problem 3

We’ll create a function to run a logistic regression and we’ll map
across cities to fit our models for each city.
